            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Generously coat a large frying pan with cooking spray. Cook and stir chorizo in the prepared pan over medium-high heat until well browned and crumbled. Add onion and chile pepper; continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until onion is tender.</li>
                <li>Beat eggs in a medium bowl and add to chorizo mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low; continue cooking and stirring until eggs are scrambled and no longer runny.</li>
                <li>Warm flour tortillas in the microwave for 30 seconds. Spoon chorizo-egg mixture into the middle of each tortilla and top with shredded Cheddar cheese. Roll up like a burrito.</li>
